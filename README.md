We decided to do our research and gather data to figure what salary options Data Scientist have based on different companies. 

The original data sources we based our analysis are from Glassdoor and Data Scientist Job Postings from U.S. We pulled this data from Kaggle.

First, we decided to clean data from the data scientist file by eliminating duplicate companies. 

From Glassdoor the data was combined based in companies names and merged to see the salries.
