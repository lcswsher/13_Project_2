## Project Report



We decided to do our research and gather data to figure what salary options Data Scientist have based on different companies. 

The original data sources we based our analysis are from Glassdoor and Data Scientist Job Postings from U.S. We pulled this data from Kaggle.

1. We decided to be specific with the job titles and work with only Data Scientist. After that was a success we moved on to companies names and eliminated duplicate companies names, the splitting method was used to have the code be succesful.

2. From Glassdoor the data was combined based in companies names and merged to see the salaries. 

3. After merging the two databases we were able to match out of 2894 companies 73 job companies and their salaries.
